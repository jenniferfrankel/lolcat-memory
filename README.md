=============

Memory game with random lolcat images

This was a hacking project at a Girl Develop It Pair-Up hackathon. The object was to write a standard memory game (find each pair of matching cards), populated with random lolcat images.

Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jenniferfrankel/lolcat-memory/blob/master/index.html "Demo").
