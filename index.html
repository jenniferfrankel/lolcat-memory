			<h2>Hedgehog memory game</h2><br/>
			<p>Click on two different cards. If they match they will stay face up, and you can continue. If they do not match they will be flipped back down. Once they are turned you can continue the game by clicking on two new cards. When you have found all 8 pairs, you win! The back of each card shows a hedgehog floating in a pool - hence the name of the game. The images to memorize are randomly chosen lolcat images from the web. Enjoy!</p>
